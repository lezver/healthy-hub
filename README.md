# healthyHub-backend
What we did:
1) Vladislav Gulida - creating the backend, connecting to mongoDB and launching on render.com, creating endpoints: register, login, logout, current, check-email, change-goal, change-settings, change-password, avatars.
2) Sergey Andrienko - creation of Swagger. 
3) Yevhen Potiyko - creation of endpoints: day(GET), day(POST), month, year, food-intake, food-intake/:id, water-intake (they agreed to do it together, so Sergiy was halping for Yevhen).
